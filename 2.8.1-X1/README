Welcome to the Google Search Appliance Connector for Livelink!

The Google Search Appliance connector framework enables Google search
appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems. An
enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

This connector for Open Text Livelink provides access to documents
and document meta-data stored in the Livelink ECM - Enterprise
Server developed by the Open Text Corporation.

The connector communicates with the Livelink Server using the Java
language Livelink Application Programming Interface (LAPI). To
properly build this connector you will need access to certain
components of the Open Text Livelink ECM - Enterprise Server SDK,
specifically lapi.jar. The Livelink SDK is a commercial product
offered by the Open Text Corporation and is not included in this
distribution.
