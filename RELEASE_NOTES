Release 2.6.6, Dec 7, 2010
==========================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality. Users of previous releases are encouraged to
upgrade. See the product website for a complete description.

Summary of Changes
------------------
For the latest details on the changes, see http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-otex/issues/list?can=0&q=label%3AMilestone-Release_2.6.6

  * Fixed issue 56: Treat LAPI I/O exceptions as transient. In
    previous releases, transient I/O-related exceptions, such as
    "Server did not accept open request", might have been treated as
    permanent document-related errors. This would lead to a skipped
    document rather than a retry.
  * Issue 58: Deprecated the Separate Authentication parameters on the
    connector configuration form. The parameter will be removed from
    the form in a future release. Use LDAP or a Universal Login
    authentication mechanism instead. For details about other options,
    see:

    http://code.google.com/apis/searchappliance/documentation/68/secure_search/secure_search_crwlsrv.html#authentication

  * Fixed issue 59: For category attributes created in older versions
    of Livelink, the Show in Search attribute field "Search" may not
    exist. The connector now assumes that the attribute should be
    indexed if the "Search" attribute field does not exist.
  * Fixed issue 61: The excludedLocationNodes advanced configuration
    property only excluded children in the same parent volume as the
    excluded items, and not the excluded items themselves or children
    in the excluded item's volumes (such as projects).

  * Fixed issue 13, with better support for doc.Fetch URLs.
  * Fixed issue 35 by allowing URLs in the Host parameter on the
    configuration form. This is not a preferred approach, it's just an
    attempt to guess what the administrator meant.
