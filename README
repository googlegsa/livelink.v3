Welcome to the Google Enterprise Connector for Open Text Livelink!

The Google Enterprise connector framework enables Google search
appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems.  
An enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

This Open Text Livelink Connector provides access to documents
and document meta-data stored in the Livelink ECM - Enterprise
Server developed by the Open Text Corporation.

The Open Text Livelink Connector communicates with the Livelink
Server using the Java language Livelink Application Programming
Interface (LAPI). To properly build this connector you will need
access to certain components of the Open Text Livelink ECM -
Enterprise Server SDK, specifically lapi.jar. The Livelink SDK
is a commercial product offered by the Open Text Corporation and
is not included in this distribution.
